This is a simple portfolio website created using HTML and basic CSS. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experience, providing a clean and professional platform to present my work. It includes:

Home Page: An introduction with a brief overview of who I am.
About Me: A section detailing my background, skills, and interests.
Projects: A showcase of my work, including descriptions and links to live demos or repositories.
Contact: A simple contact form for visitors to get in touch with me.
This project serves as both a personal portfolio and a demonstration of my front-end development skills using fundamental web technologies.

Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback or contributions are welcome!
