Portfolio Website
This is a simple portfolio website created using HTML and basic CSS. The website includes two pages:

Home Page: An introduction with a brief overview of who I am, highlighting my skills and experience.
Contact Page: A straightforward contact form that allows visitors to reach out to me.
This project is a minimalist demonstration of my front-end development skills, focusing on clean design and user-friendly navigation using fundamental web technologies.

Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback or contributions are welcome!
